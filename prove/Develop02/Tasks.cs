// Tasks for JournalApp program

// Write a new entry - Show the user a random prompt (from a list that you create), and save their response, the prompt, and the date as an Entry.

// Display the journal - Iterate through all entries in the journal and display them to the screen.

// Save the journal to a file - Prompt the user for a filename and then save the current journal (the complete list of entries) to that file location.

// Load the journal from a file - Prompt the user for a filename and then load the journal (a complete list of entries) from that file. This should replace any entries currently stored the journal.

// Provide a menu that allows the user choose these options
//write, display, save, load, quit

// Your list of prompts must contain at least five different prompts.

// Design requirments:
// Contain classes for the major components in the program.

// Contain at least two classes in addition to the Program class.

// Demonstrate the principle of abstraction by using member variables and methods appropriately.

//Note abstraction is the art of making a program look clean and desirable for other users by hiding all the complex code and using classe, method, dictionaries, or other objects to clean everything up.

//Simplifications:
// Saving your file as a .csv file requires you to handle commas and quotes in the content appropriately. At this point, you can ignore that and just choose a symbol for a separator that you think is unlikely to show up in the content (such as | or ~ or ~|~).

// You do not need to store the date as an actual C# DateTime object in your class or in the file. You can simply store it as a string.

//Stretch requirment create a class that Addresses the issue of NOT SEEING THE EMMEDIATE BENEFITS

//Every 5 entrys congratulate the user on completing a journal. Similar to prompt generator create an array of strings that includes encouraging quotes.
